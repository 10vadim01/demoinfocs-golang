# Nade trajectory overview

This example shows how to create a overview of grenade trajectories of a match.

## Running the example

`go run nade_trajectories.go -demo /path/to/demo > out.jpg`

This will create a JPGE with trajectories of the first half's CT-team. The reason it doesn't do all nades is because the image would look quite cluttered otherwise.
